        <b>Parasite Rex</b><br>
        Inside the Bizarre World of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures<br>
        By Zimmer, Carl<br>
        <br>

        A really fun read. At the end of it, you really question why anyone acts the way they do and free will. Are we just puppets with our strings pulled by millions of bacteria and flukes and what not that are teeming in our bodies?

        <b>
            Descartes' Error</b><br>
        Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain<br>
        By Damasio, Antonio R.
        <br><br>
        
        Emotion underlies all the seemingly higher level reasoning that our brain does. There are many people who would pass our cognitive reasoning tests, but still do not make the right choices. Maybe their emotional part of the brain is not well regulated.

        This is a great companion to "Thinking, fast and slow".

        <b>
            The Gene - An Intimate History & The Emperor of all maladies</b><br>
        By Mukherjee, Siddhartha
        <br>
        One reading is not enough for someone like me who loves understanding biology and biotech but has very little formal education in the subject. It is back on my "to read again" list.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>
            The Sympathizer</b><br>
        By Nguyen, Viet Thanh<br>
        <br>
        The most enjoyable fiction I have read in a while. Though-provoking, funny, sad, and with elements of historical fiction.

        <b>
            Thinking, Fast and Slow</b><br>
        By Kahneman, Daniel<br>
        <br>
        Started the book at SFO and finished it in Mumbai - about 30 hours later of non-stop reading. A must read for anyone that wants to understand how we think, and how we think we think.
