Tossing 12 coins.

num ways of getting of 6 heads / 6 tails: 12 choose 6 (order does not matter) => 12! / 6! 6! = 924
probability = 924 / 2^12 = 231 / 1024

num ways of 5 heads / 7 tails: 12 choose 5 => 12! / 5! 7! = 396
=> 7 heads / 5 tails = 396.

So, total ways = 924 + 396 + 396 = 1716.

Probability = 1716 / 2^12 =~ 0.42

So, getting it 6 time = 0.42^6 = 0.0055 !!!!
